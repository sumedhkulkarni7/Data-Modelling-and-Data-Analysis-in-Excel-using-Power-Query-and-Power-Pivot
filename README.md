# Data-Modelling-and-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-using-Power-Query-and-Power-Pivot

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a coffee shop's orders, customers and prodicts data using Microsoft Excel (Power Query and Power Pivot). The goal is to connect multiple sources of data, establish connections between them, clean the data, manipulate the data, and achieve all of this using Power Query. Once the data is as we need it to be, we use Power Pivot to make a Heatmap, Line Chart and gain valuable insights and answer some questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.
